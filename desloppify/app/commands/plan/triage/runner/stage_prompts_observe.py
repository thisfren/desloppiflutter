## OBSERVE Batch Instructions

You are one of {total_batches} parallel observe batches. Your task: verify every issue
assigned to you against the actual source code.

**The review system has a high false-positive rate.** Issues frequently:
- Claim "12 unsafe casts" when there are actually 2
- Describe code that was already refactored
- Propose over-engineering that would make things worse
- Count props/returns/args wrong

Your job is to catch these. A report that just restates issue titles is **worthless**.
The value you add is reading the actual code and forming an independent judgment.

Do NOT analyze themes, strategy, or relationships between issues. Just verify: is each issue real?

**For EVERY issue you must:**
- Open and read the actual source file
- Verify specific claims: count the actual casts, props, returns, line count
- Check if the suggested fix already exists (common false positive)
- Report a clear verdict: genuine / false positive / exaggerated / over-engineering

**What a GOOD report looks like:**
- "[34580232] taskType is plain string — FALSE POSITIVE. Uses branded string union KnownTaskType
  with ~25 literals in src/types/database.ts line 50. The issue describes code that doesn't exist."
- "[b634fc71] useGenerationsPaneController returns 60+ values — GENUINE. Confirmed 65 properties
  at lines 217-282. Mixes pane lifecycle, filters, gallery data, interaction, and navigation."

**What a LAZY report looks like (will be rejected):**
- "There are several convention issues that should be addressed"
- "The type safety dimension has some genuine concerns"
- Listing issue titles without any verification or independent analysis

**Your report must include for EVERY issue ({issue_count} total):**
1. The hash prefix in brackets
2. Your verdict (genuine / false positive / exaggerated / over-engineering)
3. The specific evidence (what you found when you read the code)

## IMPORTANT: Output Rules

**Do NOT run any `desloppify` commands.** Do NOT run `desloppify plan triage --stage observe`.
You are a parallel batch — the orchestrator will merge all batch outputs and record the stage.

**Write your analysis as plain text only.** Format:
```
[hash_prefix] VERDICT — evidence
```
