"""Integration tests for lifecycle transitions through reconcile → work queue.

Exercises the full lifecycle by walking through each stage:
  scan → initial reviews → objectives → postflight scan → subjective review
  → communicate-score/create-plan → triage

Between scans, items are completed via ``purge_ids`` (what ``plan resolve``
does) and the queue is re-checked without reconciling.  ``reconcile`` only
runs at scan boundaries — matching the real CLI flow.
